# X-GSD: Cross-platform Game Skeleton (Data-Driven)

X-GSD is a basic data-driven C++ game engine built upon SFML, developed as part of my end-of-degree project. It is a totally free and open basic game engine which aims to solve some of the problems of proprietary game engines, or being a starting point for custom solutions. It can also serve as an academic example of how to start building the core of a game, or a game engine.

The purpose of this end-of-degree project report is to explain some general concepts about video game programming, game engines and their utility, and how X-GSD is built around some of these ideas, including: types of game loop and simulation, resource management, scene graph, entity-component system, events and basic physics.


To start with, I recommend to read my [end-of-degree project report](https://github.com/AndresRuizBernabeu/X-GSD/blob/master/TFG_Andr√©sRuiz.pdf) in which I explain how each part of X-GSD is built and a mini game example.
